usage: gvp [COMMAND]

SYNOPSIS
    gvp stands for Go Versioning Packager and is based on [gst](http://github.com/tonchis/gst),
    a similar tool that provides vendoring functionality for Ruby gems.

    The tool modifies your GOPATH to point to a local .godeps/ directory so that you
    can keep the dependencies of your project isolated there, it also modifies
    GOBIN and PATH to include the new GOPATH/bin directory.

    gvp is a companion tool to [gpm](http://github.com/pote/gpm) the Go Package Manager.

USAGE
    Since gvp is a script, env changes will not happen unless you source them.

      $ source gvp

COMMANDS
    source gvp      Modifies GOPATH and GOBIN to use the .godeps directory.
    gvp version     Outputs version information.
    gvp help        Prints this message.
    gvp in          The function that is called when executing "source gvp"
    gvp out         Return the prompt to normal
